How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

- To ensure that my code, programs, and software I write is functional and secure it is important to evaluate the requirements from the user and to make sure that you are writting appropriate tests. The fundamentals of testing gives us a systematic exploration of a component or system with the main aim of finding and reporting defects. Testing does not include correction of defects.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- How somone interpretes user needs and incorporates them into a program can determine the success of a project, which is why Planning and Design are such important steps of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because they happen before any code has been written. I focus on breaking user needs into functional and non-functional requirements that determines how each should be handeled be the team going forward.

How do I approach designing software?

- My approach to designing software is focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and managing the methodologies, techniques, and tools that help during each phase of the SDLC.
